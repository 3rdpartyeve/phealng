# Pheal

Copyright (C) 2010 by Peter Petermann
All rights reserved.

Pheal is a port of EAAL to PHP

## WARNING
Pheal is not a stable release yet,
stuff might or might not work as expected

## LICENSE
Pheal is licensed under a MIT style license, see LICENSE.txt
for further information

## FEATURES
- does not need to change when EVE API changes

## REQUIREMENTS
- PHP 5.2 (might run on earlier versions, untested)


## INSTALLATION
1. `git clone git://github.com/ppetermann/pheal.git`
2. make sure your autoloader is able to find the classes
   (filename example.php matches classname "example" OR
   `include "../path/to/Pheal.php"; spl_autoload_register("Pheal::classload");`
   in your application, which will use a simple buildin autoloader

## USAGE

### Initialize the API Object
    require_once "Pheal/Pheal.php";
    spl_autoload_register("Pheal::classload");
    $pheal = new Pheal("myUserid", "myAPI key"[, "scope for request"]);
the scope is the one used for the API requests, ex. account/char/corp/eve/map/server see API Reference the scope can be changed during runtime and defaults to account

### Request Information
    $result = $pheal>ApiPage();
this will return an Object of type PhealResult which then can be used to read the api result

### Example 1, getting a list of characters on the account:
    require_once "Pheal/Pheal.php";
    spl_autoload_register("Pheal::classload");
    $pheal = new Pheal("myUserid", "myAPI key"[, "scope for request"]);

    $result = $pheal->Characters();
    foreach($result->characters as $character)
      echo $character->name;

### Example 2, getting the id for a given character name
    require_once "Pheal/Pheal.php";
    spl_autoload_register("Pheal::classload");
    $pheal = new Pheal("myUserid", "myAPI key"[, "scope for request"]);

    $pheal->scope = "eve";
    $result = $pheal->CharacterID(array("names" => "Peter Powers"));
    echo $result->characters[0]->characterID;

### Using the cache
Pheal comes with a simple file cache, to make use of this cache:
`PhealConfig::getInstance()->cache = new PhealFileCache("/path/to/cache/directory/");`
does the magic. if you dont give a path it defaults to $HOME/.pheal/cache

### Example 3, doing a cached request
    require_once "Pheal/Pheal.php";
    spl_autoload_register("Pheal::classload");
    PhealConfig::getInstance()->cache = new PhealFileCache();
    $pheal = new Pheal("myUserid", "myAPI key"[, "scope for request"]);

    $pheal->scope = "eve";
    $result = $pheal->CharacterID(array("names" => "Peter Powers"));
    echo $result->characters[0]->characterID;
now the request will first check if the xml is allready in the cache, if it is still valid, and if so use the cached, only if the cache until of the saved file has expired, it will request again.

### Exceptions
Pheal throws an Exception of type PhealAPIException (derived from PhealException)
whenever the EVE API returns an error, this exception has an attribute called "code"
which is the EVE APIs error code, and also contains the EVE API message as message.

    require_once "Pheal/Pheal.php";
    spl_autoload_register("Pheal::classload");
    PhealConfig::getInstance()->cache = new PhealFileCache();
    $pheal = new Pheal("myUserid", "myAPI key"[, "scope for request"]);
    try {
        $pheal->Killlog(array("characterID" => 12345));
    } catch(PhealAPIException $e) {
        echo 'error: ' . $e->code . ' meesage: ' . $e->getMessage();
    }
